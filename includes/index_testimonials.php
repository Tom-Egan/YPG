                            Tom and I just want to thank you and your crew for the awesome job that you did to beautify our gardens.  We received many 
                            compliments on our landscaping from our guests that attended our daughter’s graduation party.  It was a beautiful day which 
                            allowed our guests to walk around and admire your work.  We hope you and your family enjoy the rest of the summer and we look 
                            forward to seeing you again!

                            Many thanks for all your hard work leading up to the wedding. The dinner reception on the lawn turned out beautifully
                            with all the gardens in full bloom and neatly manicured. What a joy to see it all come together! Thanks for the thoughtful
                            gift of flowers. We placed it on the banquet table and it was the perfect touch.
                            </p>
