          <div class="subpage-heading-border"></div>
          <p>Slit over-seeding is a common way to economically <span class="accent-green">renew and rejuvenate an older or patchy lawn</span> by providing newly seeded grass. This technique is commonly used in the spring and fall when optimal grass growing conditions are present, thus not requiring personal watering.
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2>Core Aeration</h2>
          <div class="subpage-heading-border"></div>
          <p>Core aeration is often used in conjunction with slit over-seeding. The process of core aeration is used to cut through thatch and compacted soil allowing for relief of soil compaction, increase in water drainage, aeration to lawn, reduction in thatch layers, and a recycling of nutrients for you grass.
          </p>
